# Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exaclty.

# set days to a long string of weekday names
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# save all names of the months seperated by new line to the variable
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec"

# print the string days. There will be two whitespace between text & variable
print("Here are the days: ", days)
# print the string months. There will be two whitespace between text & variable
print("Here are the months: ", months)

# Print a multiline text
print("""
There's something goind on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""")
