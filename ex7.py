# Exercise 7: More printing

# print out a string
print("Mary had a little lamb.")
# print out the formatted string
print("Its fleece was white as {}.".format('snow'))
# print out a string
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
# print out the dot ten times
print("." * 10)

# define 12 variables each containing on letter only
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"

end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# Concatenate the first 6 variables and print them followed
# by a whitespace at the end
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end=' ')
# Concatenate variable 7 to 12 and print out the string
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
